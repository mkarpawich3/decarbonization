                                            Although the OERB has seen much success in the context of its original mission, that
                                            mission was declared around the same time that the founders of the OERB were charged
                                            by government agencies around the world as the source of global climate change.
                                            When juxtaposed with the automobile and tobacco industries of the past, the OERB
                                            appears to follow in their footsteps in its deflection of those charges,
                                            as demonstrated through its restoration and education initiatives.
                                            To further study this deflection, the next chapter analyzes a book from the
                                            OERB-produced educational children's series, “Petro Pete”.

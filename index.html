                                In 1988, James Hansen testified before Congress that oil, coal,
                                and other carbon-producing fossil fuels were responsible for
                                global warming and would have a devastating impact on the world.

                                In 1995, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its
                                Second Assessment of climate change, recognizing the conclusions
                                reached by Hansen and others on an international stage.

                                In response, the oil and natural gas industries of Oklahoma established
                                the Oklahoma Energy Resources Board in 1993, setting out on their
                                restoration and education initiatives that still exist today.

                                to the past.

                                In one book — Boomer Burrow — the OERB presents a fable in which the rumblings
                                of restoration equipment disturb a community of cartoon animals until a
                                hardhat-wearing dog-turned-liaison reassures them by explaining the benefits
                                of this restorative process on the environment.

                                The shock comes from the fact that this process is not nearly as effective as

                                the state of Oklahoma has experienced a

                                internal scar on and under the surface of the Earth that renders
                                Oklahoma communities emotionally and physically shaken.

                                One week, when all of Bummer Burrow woke up, they realized there was no
                                rumbling to disturb their sleep. The days went by and still nothing happened.<br><br>
                                “RePete was right!” said Sinclair, “The rumblings really did stop!”

                                All of Bummer Burrow held a festival, including RePete, to commemorate
                                the end of the rumblings and a return to normal life. All was happy again!<br><br>
                                Or so the animals of Bummer Burrow thought...

                                At the end of the week, something terrible happened! During the night,
                                a powerful rumbling started, stronger than all the rest. <br><br>
                                The animals sprung from their beds and scrambled about, unable to
                                find their way in the dark.

                                All of their homes had caved in, and they had nowhere to go.

                                The message of the poster is for Grove Park residents to “go green” through gradual adoption
                                of electric transportation. The visual journey of the audience starts in the top-left corner
                                with the command: “GO”. Following the arrows around the length of the edge, this message
                                grows into a statement: “Go Green Grove Park”.
                            </p>

                                More than just directional suggestions, these arrows also replicate the recycle symbol,
                                adhering to the theme of sustainability. As the viewer returns to the “GO”, they are then
                                directed towards the car because of how it visually imbalances the piece.
                                <br><br>
                                At this point, the viewer knows that the piece commands them to “go green”,
                                but is still unsure as to how.
                            </p>

                                The car directly provides context to their question, while also introducing two new ideas.
                                <br><br>
                                On the one hand, the upward angle of the car — coupled with the graph-like
                                incline through the middle of the piece — suggests growth over time.
                                On the other hand, the placement of the car at the base of this incline
                                suggests that the viewer still has work left to reach the top.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class='w' id='w37'>
                            <p class='body medium'>
                                Finished with the car, the viewer continues along the length of the
                                incline to reach the center of the piece.
                                <br><br>
                                Knowing that they must
                                “go green” in context to transportation, the viewer ideally understands
                                the juxtaposition of the plug-plant with the gas-handle-root imagery as
                                a symbol of the juxtaposition between electric and gas-fueled vehicles.

                            </p>

                                Several elements of the piece work together to create this juxtaposition.
                                <br><br>
                                Coupled with the direct comparison of smooth edges along the top image and
                                jagged ones along the bottom, the respective color and position of each
                                region (green and red, top and bottom) imply a good and bad relationship
                                through themes of Heaven and Hell. 
                            </p>

                            <p class='body medium'>
                                Furthermore, the green color aligns the electricity theme that is suggested
                                by the plug imagery with the decarbonization movement through its agreement
                                with the plant contours of the top image.
                                <br><br>
                                Meanwhile, the red color reinforces the gas theme suggested by the gas
                                handle imagery as the standard color for American gasoline cans.

                            <p class='body medium'>
                                Together, all of these design elements conclude the message of the piece
                                by providing the means by which the viewer can perform the “go green”
                                action through transportation:<br><br>
                                BY GOING ELECTRIC.

                                Other elements also develop a hopeful tone for the piece.<br><br>
                                As referenced earlier, the words “GROVE” and “PARK” are composed of a
                                majority of red letters. Paired with the lowered position of the car
                                along the incline, this majority of red letters expresses a present
                                negative condition of the Grove Park community with respect to electric transportation.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class='w' id='w42'>
                            <p class='body medium'>
                                However, the placement and upward angle of the car in the green
                                region and the open space above it both imply that the Grove Park
                                community has an opportunity — room — for growth over time.
                                <br><br>
                                Thus, this poster not only commands the audience to “go green”
                                through electric transportation...<br><br>
                                IT ENCOURAGES IT.
